# Project Overview

This repository contains code, datasets, and supporting files used for building and evaluating a reinforcement learning (RL)–based scheduling policy for a call-center simulation model. The trained RL agent is provided, while the full simulation code is not included due to privacy restrictions.

## Repository Contents

### **1. Trained RL Model**
- `rl_scheduler.pkl`  
  This file contains the trained RL object used to make scheduling decisions within the simulation environment.

---

### **2. Data Files**
Although the simulation code itself cannot be shared, the datasets used at different stages of the workflow are included in separate folders. These datasets contain:
- Input data used to run the simulation model  
- Data used to train the RL model  
- Data generated by running the RL policy inside the simulation model  

These files allow reproduction of the analysis and results without exposing the underlying proprietary simulator.

## Jupyter Notebooks

### **Dataset Generation**
- **`Dataset Generator True.ipynb`**  
  Generates the “true” datasets used in the simulation model. These datasets mimic real-world call-log data and serve as the underlying source of arrival and service patterns.

- **`Dataset Generator.ipynb`**  
- **`Fit Arrival.ipynb`**  
- **`Fit BO Generator.ipynb`**  
- **`Fit Copula.ipynb`**  
  These notebooks generate all additional files needed for the simulation pipeline, including fitted distributions for arrivals, back-office work, and copula-based dependence structures.

---

## Expert-Specific Inputs

The following files provide expert-level configuration information used by the simulation model:

- `expert_data_raw.csv`  
- `threshold_data.csv`  

These inputs contain parameters and thresholds specific to expert operators and are used within the simulation logic.

---

## Additional Notes

- The **`Fit Arrival.ipynb`** notebook includes the full analysis pipeline for processing arrival data, generating histograms, and fitting appropriate input models.
- All datasets and notebooks are organized to allow reproducible analysis even without access to the proprietary simulation engine.
